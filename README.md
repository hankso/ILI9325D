# ILI9325D
There is nice ILI9325D lib available on github but only for atmega2560

This version is modified based on `u8g_dev_ili9325d_320x240.c` and [`MultiLCD`](https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc/MultiLCD), it support avr atmega328p.

Because it doesn't use platform specified API, WiringPi(WiringOP etc.) or `ARM` is also compatible ;)

# Usage
As normal Arduino lib or compile with `-lWiringPi`
